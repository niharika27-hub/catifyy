## Important Notes

### ‚úÖ What Works on Deployment:
- All pages (index, songs, library, playlists, etc.)
- Deezer API music streaming (30-second previews)
- Playlist creation and management
- Like/unlike functionality
- Search features
- Responsive design

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- Songs play for 30 seconds only (Deezer API free tier)
- Some songs may not be found on Deezer
- Internet connection required for music playback

### üéµ How Music Works in Production:
1. User clicks a song
2. App searches Deezer API for matching track
3. If found: plays 30-second preview
4. If not found: shows error and skips to next song
5. No audio files are stored or downloaded

### üîß Troubleshooting:

**Problem: Songs not playing**
- Solution: Check browser console (F12) for API errors
- Deezer API should work without CORS issues
- Make sure you have internet connection

**Problem: Blank page on deployment**
- Solution: Check that all HTML files are in the root directory
- Verify vercel.json configuration (if using custom config)

**Problem: Images not loading**
- Solution: Check that image paths use relative paths (`./images/`)
- Verify images folder is committed to git

### üì± Test Your Deployment:

After deploying, test these features:
1. Click songs on home page - should play via API
2. Create a playlist - should save in browser localStorage
3. Like songs - should persist after refresh
4. Open playlist - songs should be clickable and playable
5. Library page - should show stats and playlists

### üöÄ Performance Tips:

- Site should load in < 2 seconds
- First song may take 2-3 seconds to find via API
- LocalStorage works on all modern browsers
- Mobile responsive design works on all devices

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try different browsers

Happy streaming! üéµ‚ú®
