## üéØ Expected Behavior

| Step | What Should Happen | Check For |
|------|-------------------|-----------|

## ‚ùå If Songs Don't Play - What to Check

### Check 1: Is MusicAPI Loaded?
```javascript
// In console, type:
typeof MusicAPI
// Should show: "function"
// If shows "undefined", script didn't load - refresh page
```

### Check 2: Is Music API Search Working?
```javascript
// In console, type:
const api = new MusicAPI();
api.searchSong('Die With a Smile', 'Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars').then(r => console.log(r))

// Should see result in 2-3 seconds:
// {id: [...], title: "Die With a Smile", preview_url: "https://...", ...}
```

### Check 3: Check Console Errors
Look for **red error messages** in console:
- **Network Error**: Check internet connection
- **CORS Error**: Browser blocking API (unlikely, Deezer allows)
- **Undefined variable**: Refresh page

### Check 4: Try These Known Working Songs
These should definitely play:
- **Die With a Smile** - Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars
- **Shape of You** - Ed Sheeran  
- **Gul** - Anuv Jain

2. **30-Second Previews**: Deezer API only gives short clips
3. **Not All Songs Available**: Regional songs may not be on Deezer
4. **Console is Your Friend**: Always check F12 console first
5. **Refresh If Stuck**: Press Ctrl+R to reload everything

2. **Press**: F12 (open console)
3. **Click**: "P-POP Culture" album
